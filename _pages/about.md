I am currently a Ph.D. student in Industrial Systems Engineering at National University of Singapore (NUS), where I am supervised by Prof. [Andrew Lim](https://www.limandrew.org/) and Prof. [Chee Yeow Meng](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=99AJNXEAAAAJ). 

Before that, I received my B.E. in Computer Science from South China University of Technology (SCUT) in 2019, whre I was supervised by Prof. [Yue-Jiao Gong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Mi0Zu3IAAAAJ&hl=en).

Research Interests
======
My main research interests are <font color="blue">"learning to optimize"</font>, where we exploit machine learning (deep learning and reinforcement Learning) to solve challenging optimization problems including both combinatorial optimization and black-box continuous optimization problems. I'm also interested in distributed/federated machine learning and Evolutionary Computation.

- **Artificial Intelligence**: Deep Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, Federated Learning
- **Evolutionary Computation** Ant Colony Optimization, Differential Evolution
- **Combinatorial Optimization**: Vehicle Routing, Path Planning
