Welcome to my homepage!

I am currently a researcher at [S-Lab for Advanced Intelligence](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/s-lab), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), where I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Jie Zhang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/zhangj/). At the same time, I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Industrial Systems Engineering at National University of Singapore (NUS), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yeow Meng Chee](https://ymchee66.github.io/home/). In recent years, I am also fortunate to work closely with [Asst. Prof. Zhiguang Cao](https://zhiguangcaosg.github.io/) from Singapore Management University (SMU). Prior to that, I received my B.E. degree from School of Computer Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology (SCUT) in June 2019, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yuejiao Gong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Mi0Zu3IAAAAJ&hl=en). Welcome to see my [publications](https://yining043.github.io/publications/), [academic services](https://yining043.github.io/service/), [experience](https://yining043.github.io/experience/), as well as [honors & awards](https://yining043.github.io/honors/) to learn more about me, and welcome to reach out for collaboration!

# Research Interests
My current research focus is "**Learning to Optimize**", where we exploit machine learning (deep learning and reinforcement Learning) to solve challenging optimization problems including both combinatorial optimization and black-box continuous optimization problems. I'm also interested in distributed/federated machine learning and swarm intelligence.

**Keywords**
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, Federated Learning
- **Optimization**: Vehicle Routing, Path Planning, Protein Docking, Transportation, Logitics
- **Swarm Intelligence**: Differential Evolution, Particle Swarm Optimization,  Ant Colony Optimization, Genetic Algorithm
