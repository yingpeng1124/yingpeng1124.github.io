Welcome to my homepage!

I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Industrial Systems Engineering at National University of Singapore (NUS), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Yeow Meng Chee](https://ymchee66.github.io/home/).
Before that, I received my B.E. degree in Computer Science from South China University of Technology (SCUT) in June 2019.
<!-- , where I was supervised by Prof. [Yue-Jiao Gong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Mi0Zu3IAAAAJ&hl=en). -->
Welcome to see my [publications](https://yining043.github.io/publications/), [academic services](https://yining043.github.io/service/), [experience](https://yining043.github.io/experience/), as well as [honors & awards](https://yining043.github.io/honors/) to learn more about me, and welcome to reach out for collaboration!

# Research Interests
My current research focus is "Learning to Optimize", where we exploit machine learning (deep learning and reinforcement Learning) to solve challenging optimization problems including both combinatorial optimization and black-box continuous optimization problems. I'm also interested in distributed/federated machine learning and evolutionary computation.

- **Evolutionary Computation**: Ant Colony Optimization, Differential Evolution
- **Combinatorial Optimization**: Vehicle Routing, Path Planning
