Welcome to my homepage!

I am currently a Ph.D. student in Industrial Systems Engineering at National University of Singapore (NUS), where I am supervised by Prof. [Andrew Lim](https://www.limandrew.org/) and Prof. [Chee Yeow Meng](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=99AJNXEAAAAJ). 

Before that, I received my B.E. in Computer Science from South China University of Technology (SCUT) in 2019, whre I was supervised by Prof. [Yue-Jiao Gong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Mi0Zu3IAAAAJ&hl=en).

# Research Interests
My main research focus is "learning to optimize", where we exploit machine learning (deep learning and reinforcement Learning) to solve challenging optimization problems including both combinatorial optimization and black-box continuous optimization problems. I'm also interested in distributed/federated machine learning and Evolutionary Computation.
### Keywords
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Deep Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, Federated Learning
- **Evolutionary Computation**: Ant Colony Optimization, Differential Evolution
- **Combinatorial Optimization**: Vehicle Routing, Path Planning
