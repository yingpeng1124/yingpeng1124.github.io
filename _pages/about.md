I am currently a Ph.D. student in College of Design and Engineering at National University of Singapore (NUS), where I am supervised by Prof. [Andrew Lim](https://www.limandrew.org/) and Prof. [Chee Yeow Meng](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=99AJNXEAAAAJ). Before that, I received my B.E. in Computer Science from South China University of Technology (SCUT) in 2019, whre I was supervised by Prof. [Yue-Jiao Gong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Mi0Zu3IAAAAJ&hl=en). I have published several papers in the refereed conferences (NeurIPS and IJCAI), and journals (IEEE Transactions).

Research Interests
======
My main research interests are <font color="blue">Learning for Optimization (L4Opt)</font>, where we exploit Machine Learning (deep learning and reinforcement Learning) to address challenging Optimization problems including both combinatorial optimization problems and the black-box continuous optimization problems. I'm also interested in distributed/federated machine learning, evolutionary algorithms, and other heuristics for real-world optimization applications.

**Keywords**

- **Artificial Intelligence**: Machine Learning (Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, Federated Learning),
Evolutionary Computation (Genetic Algorithm, Ant Colony Optimization), Heuristics
- **Combinatorial Optimization**: Vehicle Routing, Path Planning, and Other Real-World Applications
