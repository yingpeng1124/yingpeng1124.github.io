Hi, I am currently a researcher at the College of Computing and Data Science, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), working in collaboration with [Prof. Jie Zhang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/zhangj/). I am pending the graduation of my Ph.D. in Industrial Systems Engineering at National University of Singapore (NUS), adviced by [Prof. Yeow Meng Chee](https://ymchee66.github.io/home/). I received my B.E. degree from School of Computer Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology (SCUT), in June 2019, under the supervision of [Prof. Yuejiao Gong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Mi0Zu3IAAAAJ&hl=en). I have also collaborated closely with [Asst. Prof. Zhiguang Cao](https://zhiguangcaosg.github.io/) from Singapore Management University (SMU). My research has been featured in prestigious conferences and journals, including *NeurIPS*, *ICLR*, *IJCAI*, *TNNLS*, *TITS*, etc. I have served as an Area Chair for the *IEEE CAI* conference and a Reviewer/PC Member for top-tier conferences such as *ICML*, *NeurIPS*, *ICLR*, etc, along with several IEEE transactions and Elsevier journals.

Welcome to see my [publications](https://yining043.github.io/publications/), [academic services](https://yining043.github.io/service/), [experience](https://yining043.github.io/experience/), and [honors & awards](https://yining043.github.io/honors/), and welcome to reach out for collaboration or invited talks!

ðŸ’¡ Research Interests
-----
I am working at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Optimization**, striving to develop automated AI solutions in addressing complex optimization challenges. 

Recently, my research has focused on the emerging field of "**Learning to Optimize (L2Opt)**", where the latest AI techniques (e.g., reinforcement learning, deep learning, large language models, etc) are exploited to develop the state-of-the-art AI-powered frameworks/approaches for addressing challenging optimization problems (e.g., combinatorial optimization, black-box optimization, multi-objective optimization, etc). My research in L2Opt spans various machine learning perspectives, such as representation learning, foundational model development, efficient training/inference framework design, out-of-distribution generalization, multi-agent coordination, decision-making in dynamic environments, etc.

Besides, my research also extends to broader AI domains, including distributed/federated learning, multi-agent systems, computational intelligence, and their real-world applications.

**Research Keywords**
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, Large Language Model (LLM), Federated/Distributed Learning, Multi-Agent Systems, Computational Intelligence
- **Optimization**: Combinatorial Optimization, Black-Box Optimization
- **Application**: Routing, Planning, Logistics, Transportation, Autonomous Vehicles
