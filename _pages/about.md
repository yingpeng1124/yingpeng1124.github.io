Hi! My name is Du Yingpeng. I am a Research Assistant Professor (research fellow) at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/)'s [College of Computing and Data Science](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/computing), mentored by [Prof. Zhang Jie](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/zhangj/). Before that, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Software Engineering at Peking University (PKU), in July 2023, where I am advised by [Prof. Liu Hongzhi](https://www.ss.pku.edu.cn/teacherteam/teacherlist/2267-%E5%88%98%E5%AE%8F%E5%BF%97.html) and [Prof. Wu Zhonghai](https://www.ss.pku.edu.cn/teacherteam/teacherlist/1669-%E5%90%B4%E4%B8%AD%E6%B5%B7.html). I received my M.Eng. degree in Computer Technology at Peking University (PKU), in July 2019, where I am advised by [Prof. Liu Hongzhi](https://www.ss.pku.edu.cn/teacherteam/teacherlist/2267-%E5%88%98%E5%AE%8F%E5%BF%97.html).
I received my B.S. degree from School of Mathematics, Sichuan University (SCU), in June 2016. I have published more than 20 papers in top-tier journals and conferences, such as TPAMI, JMLR, Pattern Recognition, AAAI, SIGKDD, ICDM, IJCAI, and WWW.

## ðŸ’¡ Research Interests

My research focuses on recommender systems and ensemble learning (AI and data mining in computer science). I am interested in the problems of utilizing different kinds of information, e.g. sequential information and side information, and models to enhance the accuracy and stability of systems. Recently, I am interested in utilizing large language models to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of recommender systems. To this end, I mainly study the following topics: ambiguity decomposition theory, diversity learning, sequential pattern mining, graph representation, causal learning, reinforcement learning, large language model-based recommendation, etc.

### Research Keywords
**Recommender systems**ï¼šGeneral recommendation, Sequential recommendation, context-aware recommendation, social recommendation, attribute-based recommendation, job recommendation, graph-based recommendation and etc. 

**LLM-based recommendation**: Effectiveness and efficiency issues in recomemnder systems, e.g., self-reflection, text enhancement, knowledge distillation, and etc.

**Ensemble learning**: Ambiguity decomposition theory, Ranking ensemble, Sequential ensemble, and etc.
